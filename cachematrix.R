## Programming Assignment 2: Lexical Scoping
##
## In this example we introduce the <<- operator which can be used to assign 
## a value to an object in an environment that is different from the current 
## environment. Below are two functions that are used to create a special object 
## that stores a numeric matrix and cache's its inverse.


## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
